# info
pretty bad grep clone, only v0.0001 so dont expect it to work



# use
just drop your txt files into the sigsearch folder
make sure the txt file is in list format e.g:
* hello
* star
* please
(ignore the bullet points)


* to run it type: cargo run [word you want to find] [name of text file.txt]
* so a example use would be cargo run star test.txt
* MAKE SURE RUST IS INSTALLED FFS
